# Askify - Your Document Processing Assistant 🚀

**Introducing Askify**

Hey everyone! I embarked on a fun project inspired by a cool document processing tool I came across. 💻

Using OpenAI API, Langchain, a Vector database, and a few document processing libraries, I created **Askify** - my own version of the tool! 

## Features 🎉

- **Summarization**: Quickly summarize lengthy documents for easy understanding.
- **Ask Your Document**: Ask specific questions about your document, and Askify will provide accurate answers.
- **Generate Quiz**: Turn your document into a quiz to aid in learning.
